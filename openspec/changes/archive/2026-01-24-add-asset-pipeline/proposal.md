# Change: Add Automated Asset Pipeline for PMD-Style Sprites

## Why

The game currently uses programmatically generated placeholder graphics (colored circles/squares). To improve visual quality and align with the Pokémon theme, we need real PMD-style sprites. Manually downloading and processing sprites is tedious and error-prone—an automated pipeline ensures consistency, repeatability, and easy expansion.

## What Changes

- **[NEW]** Python script (`scripts/download_assets.py`) to fetch PMD-style sprites from PMDCollab (https://sprites.pmdcollab.org)
- **[NEW]** Requirements file (`scripts/requirements.txt`) with `requests` and `Pillow` dependencies
- **[MODIFY]** Sprite manifest format at `public/assets/manifest.json` to include frame metadata
- **[DOC]** Integration instructions for updating the Phaser Preloader scene

## Data Source

The script will use **PMDCollab Sprite Repository** (https://sprites.pmdcollab.org) which provides:
- PMD-style sprites for all Pokémon (indexed by Pokédex number)
- Animation sheets with multiple poses (Idle, Walk, Attack, etc.)
- Direct download links for sprite sheets
- Free to use with credit to artists (non-commercial)

Based on the repository structure, sprites are organized as:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PMDCollab/SpriteCollab/master/sprite/
└── {pokedex_number}/
    ├── Anim-Front.png      # Contains all front-facing animations
    ├── Anim-Back.png       # Contains all back-facing animations
    └── AnimData.xml        # Animation metadata (frame counts, offsets)
```

The script will:
1. Parse `AnimData.xml` to extract Walk animation frame data
2. Download `Anim-Front.png` sprite sheet
3. Extract Walk frames and stitch into horizontal strip

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: New `asset-pipeline` spec (standalone tooling capability)
- **Affected code**:
  - `scripts/download_assets.py` (new)
  - `scripts/requirements.txt` (new)
  - `public/assets/manifest.json` (regenerated by script)
  - `public/assets/sprites/*.png` (regenerated by script)
  - `src/game/scenes/` (Preloader integration—documentation only)

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **PMDCollab Usage Policy**: These sprites are free for ROM hacks and fangames but **not for commercial projects**. Confirm this is acceptable for your use case.

> [!NOTE]  
> The existing `manifest.json` and sprites will be regenerated. The current inconsistent frame sizes (32-280px) will be normalized.
