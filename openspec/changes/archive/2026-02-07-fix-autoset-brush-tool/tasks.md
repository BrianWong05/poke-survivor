## 1. Investigation

- [x] 1.1 Locate the Brush Tool implementation in the Level Editor codebase.
- [x] 1.2 Identify the discrepancy between single-click tile placement and drag-painting logic.

## 2. Implementation

- [x] 2.1 Update the drag-painting handler to use the full tile placement logic (including neighbor updates).
- [x] 2.2 Verify that auto-tiling triggers correctly during painting.

## 3. Verification

- [x] 3.1 Test in Level Editor: Paint lines and blocks using the brush tool and ensure tiles connect seamlessly.
- [x] 3.2 Ensure performance is acceptable (no major lag during painting).
