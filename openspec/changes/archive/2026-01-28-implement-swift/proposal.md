# Proposal: Implement Swift (高速星星)

## Problem
The player lacks a high-speed, non-random, directional "volley" style weapon. Existing weapons are either random AOE (Sludge Bomb), proximity-based (Aqua Ring), or auto-targeting (Aura Sphere).

## Solution
Implement "Swift" aka "Parallel Volley".
It fires a vertical wall of star projectiles in a straight horizontal line.
It emphasizes positioning and "clearing a path".
Upgrades focus on increasing the count (height of wall) and pierce (clearing depth).

## Impact
- **New Gameplay Style**: Encourages players to align horizontally with threats.
- **Visuals**: Distinct "spinning star" projectile.
- **Mechanics**: Guaranteed hit line with high speed.
