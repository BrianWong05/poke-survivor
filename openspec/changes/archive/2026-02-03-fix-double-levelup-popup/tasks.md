## 1. Implementation

- [x] 1.1 Update `MainScene.ts` to separate level-up application (`processLevelUp`) from recursion check.
- [x] 1.2 Verify `processLevelUp()` is called exactly once per level-up event.
- [x] 1.3 Ensure `startLevelUpSequence` recurses only when `nextLevel` is actually available.

## 2. Verification

- [x] 2.1 Verify single level up triggers exactly one popup.
- [x] 2.2 Verify multiple level ups trigger sequential popups.
