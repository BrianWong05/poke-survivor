# Redesign Petal Dance Visuals

## Why
The user requested a redesign because the current pink circles do not look like "Petals". The desired effect is swirls of falling/spinning petals.

## What Changes
- **Visuals**: Replace circular projectile with a procedural "petal" texture (Pink Ellipse/Teardrop).
- **Animation**: Add tumbling (self-rotation) and potentially erratic movement.
- **Formation**: Add radius/position variance so they don't form a perfect rigid line.

## Verification
- Visual inspection of the "petal cloud" effect.
- Hitbox consistency check.
